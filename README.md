<!-- Intro Section -->
I'm currently a **PhD student** at **St. Jude Children's Research Hospital**, where I focus on **viral/bacterial co-infections**. I'm passionate about understanding complex host-pathogen interactions and developing innovative methods for **virome analysis**.

I primarily work with **R**, **SHELL**, and **Python**, and I'm always exploring new ways to harness these tools in bioinformatics. My goal is to contribute to the scientific community by advancing our understanding of viromes and their role in health and disease.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** R, Shell scripting, Python
- **Bioinformatics Tools:** BWA, VarScan, Samtools, Trim Galore, SNPeff
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Tidyverse, ggplot2, Shiny
- **Operating Systems:** Linux, MacOS
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 🔭 What I'm currently working on
- **PhD Research**: Investigating viral and bacterial co-infections using computational methods.
- **Virome Analysis**: Developing new methods for virome analysis in complex infection models.
- **Learning**: Exploring metagenomics tools and techniques to enhance viral sequencing data interpretation.

## 🌱 What I want to learn next
- Machine learning applications in virome analysis
- Advanced Python libraries for bioinformatics
- Metagenomics and long-read sequencing analysis techniques
